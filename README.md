Ultrasonic Sensor Alarm Project

Project Summary: This Arduino project implements an ultrasonic distance monitoring system using the SR04 ultrasonic sensor. 
The system continuously measures the distance to nearby objects and displays real-time distance readings on an LCD screen. 
An alarm mechanism is activated if the detected distance falls below a specified threshold, indicating potential danger. 
The code is structured to handle sensor readings, alarm states, and LCD updates without blocking the main execution flow, ensuring efficient operation.

Key Components: 
Arduino Uno Board
SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
LiquidCrystal LCD
Active Buzzer
Potentiometer
LED
Large Breadboard
220 Ohm Resistor (x2)
Jumper Wires

Key Features: The system provides continuous monitoring of distance using the SR04 ultrasonic sensor and displays the data on a user-friendly LCD interface. 
It incorporates an alarm mechanism that triggers visual and audible alerts when an object is detected within 15 cm, indicating a potential hazard. 
The project includes non-blocking code that ensures responsive updates on the LCD without delays, allowing for other tasks to run simultaneously. 
Additionally, the LED blinks at different rates based on the distance measured, providing a visual cue alongside the buzzer alerts.
This project is ideal for applications in safety monitoring and obstacle detection.
